# landing-homepage
My learning field regarding html, css and JavaScript as a small landing page project.

Here are some thoughts I want to collect as some notes.

- top
  - Shall be named as main()
  - Small and concise introduction with some JS+css animations
- aboutme
  - Shall be named this->info()
  - JS+css animated informations. Maybe a PPT that has my milestones as a slide each?
- work
  - Shall be named volatile workload; because this always changes
  - Some work and hobby related informations
  - some projects
- links
  - Shall be named goto services; because I host some services myself
- impressum
  - Shall be named assert(compliance); because I hereby assert my compliance to impressum
  - Just some normal impressum, nothing special. Also Links to my socials.
